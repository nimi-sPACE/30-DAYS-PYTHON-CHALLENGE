# Day 4
WHAT I LEARNT:

# strings
Text is a string data type. Any data type written as text is a string. Any data under single, double or triple quote are strings. There are different string methods and built-in functions to deal with string data types. To check the length of a string use the len() method

# HOW TO CREATE A STRING:
```python
letter = 'P'                # A string could be a single character or a bunch of texts
print(letter)               # P
print(len(letter))          # 1
greeting = 'Hello, World!'  # String could be made using a single or double quote,"Hello, World!"
print(greeting)             # Hello, World!
print(len(greeting))        # 13
sentence = "I hope you are enjoying 30 days of Python Challenge"
print(sentence)
```
Multiline string is created by using triple single (''') or triple double quotes ("""). See the example below.
```python
multiline_string = '''I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python.'''
print(multiline_string)

# Another way of doing the same thing
multiline_string = """I am a teacher and enjoy teaching.
I didn't find anything as rewarding as empowering people.
That is why I created 30 days of python."""
print(multiline_string)
```
# String Concatenation
We can connect strings together. Merging or connecting strings is called concatenation. See the example below:
```python
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
space = ' '
full_name = first_name  +  space + last_name
print(full_name) # Asabeneh Yetayeh
# Checking the length of a string using len() built-in function
print(len(first_name))  # 8
print(len(last_name))   # 7
print(len(first_name) > len(last_name)) # True
print(len(full_name)) # 16
```
# Escape Sequences in Strings
In Python and other programming languages \ followed by a character is an escape sequence. Let us see the most common escape characters:

\n: new line

\t: Tab means(8 spaces)

\\: Back slash

\': Single quote (')

\": Double quote (")

Examples:
```python
print('I hope everyone is enjoying the Python Challenge.\nAre you ?') # line break
print('Days\tTopics\tExercises') # adding tab space or 4 spaces
print('Day 1\t5\t5')
print('Day 2\t6\t20')
print('Day 3\t5\t23')
print('Day 4\t1\t35')
print('This is a backslash  symbol (\\)') # To write a backslash
print('In every programming language it starts with \"Hello, World!\"') # to write a double quote inside a single quote

# output
I hope every one is enjoying the Python Challenge.
Are you ?
Days  Topics  Exercises
Day 1	5	    5
Day 2	6	    20
Day 3	5	    23
Day 4	1	    35
This is a backslash  symbol (\)
In every programming language it starts with "Hello, World!"
```
# String Formatting
Old Style String Formatting (% Operator)
In Python there are many ways of formatting strings. In this section, we will cover some of them. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s", "%d", "%f", "%.number of digitsf".

%s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)

%d - Integers

%f - Floating point numbers

"%.number of digitsf" - Floating point numbers with fixed precision
```python
# Strings only
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
language = 'Python'
formated_string = 'I am %s %s. I teach %s' %(first_name, last_name, language)
print(formated_string)

# Strings  and numbers
radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
formated_string = 'The area of circle with a radius %d is %.2f.' %(radius, area) # 2 refers the 2 significant digits after the point

python_libraries = ['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']
formated_string = 'The following are python libraries:%s' % (python_libraries)
print(formated_string) # "The following are python libraries:['Django', 'Flask', 'NumPy', 'Matplotlib','Pandas']"
```

# Python Strings as Sequences of Characters.
Python strings are sequences of characters, and share their basic methods of access with other Python ordered sequences of objects – lists and tuples. The simplest way of extracting single characters from strings (and individual members from any sequence) is to unpack them into corresponding variables.

UNPACKING CHARACTERS:
```python
language = 'Python'
a,b,c,d,e,f = language # unpacking sequence characters into variables
print(a) # P
print(b) # y
print(c) # t
print(d) # h
print(e) # o
print(f) # n
```
ACCESSING CHARACTERS IN STRINGS BY INDEX.
![alt text](image.png)

```python
language = 'Python'
first_letter = language[0]
print(first_letter) # P
second_letter = language[1]
print(second_letter) # y
last_index = len(language) - 1
last_letter = language[last_index]
print(last_letter) # n
```
If we want to start from right end we can use negative indexing. -1 is the last index.
```python
language = 'Python'
last_letter = language[-1]
print(last_letter) # n
second_last = language[-2]
print(second_last) # o
```

# SLICING PYTHON STRINGS
In python we can slice strings into substrings.

```python
language = 'Python'
first_three = language[0:3] # starts at zero index and up to 3 but not include 3
print(first_three) #Pyt
last_three = language[3:6]
print(last_three) # hon
# Another way
last_three = language[-3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
last_three = language[3:]
print(last_three)   # hon
```

# Reversing a String
Strings can easily be reversed in python.
```python
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
print(greeting[::-1]) # !dlroW ,olleH
```

# Skipping Characters while slicing
It is possible to skip characters while slicing by passing step argument to slice method.
```python
language = 'Python'
pto = language[0:6:2] #
print(pto) # Pto
```

# STRING METHODS.
There are many string methods which allows us to format strings..
Example:
. capitalize():  Converts the first character of the string to capital letter
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.capitalize()) # 'Thirty days of python'
```

. count(): returns occurrences of substring in string, count(substring, start=.., end=..). The start is a starting indexing for counting and end is the last index to count.
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.count('y')) # 3
print(challenge.count('y', 7, 14)) # 1, 
print(challenge.count('th')) # 2`
```

. endswith(): Checks if a string ends with a specified ending
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.endswith('on'))   # True
print(challenge.endswith('tion')) # False
```

. expandtabs(): Replaces tab character with spaces, default tab size is 8. It takes tab size argument
```python
challenge = 'thirty\tdays\tof\tpython'
print(challenge.expandtabs())   # 'thirty  days    of      python'
print(challenge.expandtabs(10)) # 'thirty    days      of        python'
```

. find(): Returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring, if not found returns -1
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.find('y'))  # 5
print(challenge.find('th')) # 0
```

. rfind(): Returns the index of the last occurrence of a substring, if not found returns -1
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.rfind('y'))  # 16
print(challenge.rfind('th')) # 17
```

. format(): formats string into a nicer output
```python
first_name = 'Asabeneh'
last_name = 'Yetayeh'
age = 250
job = 'teacher'
country = 'Finland'
sentence = 'I am {} {}. I am a {}. I am {} years old. I live in {}.'.format(first_name, last_name, job, age, country)
print(sentence) # I am Asabeneh Yetayeh. I am 250 years old. I am a teacher. I live in Finland.

radius = 10
pi = 3.14
area = pi * radius ** 2
result = 'The area of a circle with radius {} is {}'.format(str(radius), str(area))
print(result) # The area of a circle with radius 10 is 314
```

. index(): Returns the lowest index of a substring, additional arguments indicate starting and ending index (default 0 and string length - 1). If the substring is not found it raises a valueError.
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
sub_string = 'da'
print(challenge.index(sub_string))  # 7
print(challenge.index(sub_string, 9)) # error
```
. rindex(): Returns the highest index of a substring, additional arguments indicate starting and ending index (default 0 and string length - 1)
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
sub_string = 'da'
print(challenge.rindex(sub_string))  # 7
print(challenge.rindex(sub_string, 9)) # error
print(challenge.rindex('on', 8)) # 19
```

. isalnum(): Checks alphanumeric character
```python
challenge = 'ThirtyDaysPython'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # True

challenge = '30DaysPython'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # True

challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # False, space is not an alphanumeric character

challenge = 'thirty days of python 2019'
print(challenge.isalnum()) # False
```

. isalpha(): Checks if all string elements are alphabet characters (a-z and A-Z)
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isalpha()) # False, space is once again excluded
challenge = 'ThirtyDaysPython'
print(challenge.isalpha()) # True
num = '123'
print(num.isalpha())      # False
```

challenge = '\u00B2'
print(challenge.isdigit())   # True 
challenge = '12 3'
print(challenge.isdecimal())  # False, space not allowed
```

. isdigit(): Checks if all characters in a string are numbers (0-9 and some other unicode characters for numbers)
```python
challenge = 'Thirty'
print(challenge.isdigit()) # False
challenge = '30'
print(challenge.isdigit())   # True
challenge = '\u00B2'
print(challenge.isdigit())   # True
```

. isnumeric(): Checks if all characters in a string are numbers or number related (just like isdigit(), just accepts more symbols, like ½)
```python
num = '10'
print(num.isnumeric()) # True
num = '\u00BD' # ½
print(num.isnumeric()) # True
num = '10.5'
print(num.isnumeric()) # False
```
. isidentifier(): Checks for a valid identifier - it checks if a string is a valid variable name
```python 
challenge = '30DaysOfPython'
print(challenge.isidentifier()) # False, because it starts with a number
challenge = 'thirty_days_of_python'
print(challenge.isidentifier()) # True
```
. islower(): Checks if all alphabet characters in the string are lowercase
```python 
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.islower()) # True
challenge = 'Thirty days of python'
print(challenge.islower()) # False
```
. isupper(): Checks if all alphabet characters in the string are uppercase
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.isupper()) #  False
challenge = 'THIRTY DAYS OF PYTHON'
print(challenge.isupper()) # True
```

. join(): Returns a concatenated string

```

. replace(): Replaces substring with a given string.
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.replace('python', 'coding')) # 'thirty days of coding'
```

. split(): Splits the string, using given string or space as a separator
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'

```
. title(): Returns a title cased string
```python
challenge = 'thirty days of python'
print(challenge.title()) # Thirty Days Of Python
```

. swapcase(): Converts all uppercase characters to lowercase and all lowercase characters to uppercase characters
